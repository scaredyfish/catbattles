employed to kill vermin received particular mention in a judgment given by mr j h luxford sm in the magistrate court this week the case related to certain furniture and personal effects which as the magistrate remarked were either damaged or destroyed by rats mice or other vermin while stored in the premises of a storage contractor damages totalling 71 10s lid were claimed the evidence showed that the premises had been used for storage purposes for many years said mr luxford and that only once before had goods been damaged by verminthat had been eight years ago a cat had been installed on the premises as a result and as no complaint about damage by vermin had been made by any of the storage customers the defendant had assumed that the cat had effectively performed its duties no steps were taken to ascertain whether any vermin had escaped the vigilance of the cat the question arises whether the defendant belief based on past ex j peiiience that the premises were free from vermin or at least kept safely free by the activity of the cat amounts to such care and diligence as a careful and prudent man would exercise in relation to his own property said mr luxford the war against rats and mice must be incessant particularly in places where articles of a non-ferrous nature were stored no careful or prudent man in such circumstances would omit to search frequently for evidence of vermin in his opinion inspections should have been made once a month at least and probably once a week said mr luxford whatever the frequency it was clear that some inspections should have been made judgment was entered for the plaintiff for 42 10s", "image": "114-191-22.jpg", "collection": ["Evening Post", "Papers Past"], "date": ["1939-12-22T00:00:00.000Z"], "id": 17223899, "urlDNZ":
